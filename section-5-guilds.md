# Section 5: Trade Guilds & Organizations

## Guild System Overview

The kingdom of Mahikavati Rajya operates through an extensive network of professional guilds and organizations that span across all seven Subahs while maintaining local branches adapted to regional economic specializations. These guilds function as para-kingdom organizations that coordinate economic activities, maintain professional standards, and provide advancement opportunities independent of administrative boundaries.

Guild membership remains open to all qualified individuals regardless of ancestry or origin, with advancement based on demonstrated competence, professional skill, and contribution to guild objectives.
